# Iot-Projects-on-Arduino
This repository is built for storing some of the earliest codes written by me (some dating back to 2014, still work well).
They are all source codes of IOT Projects done when I was in High School.
Might serve as a good evidence of how I found my enthusiasm in coding and improved my TERRIBLE coding style.
