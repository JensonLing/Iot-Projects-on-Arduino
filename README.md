# Iot-Projects-on-Arduino
This repository is built for storing some of the earliest codes written by Jerison Ling (some dating back to 2014, still work well).
They are the source codes for a couple of IOT Projects done when I was in High School.
Might serve as a good evidence of how I found my enthusiasm in coding and improved my TERRIBLE coding style.
